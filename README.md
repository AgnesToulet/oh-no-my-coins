<h1>Welcome to my first game - developed and designed in one weekend!</h1>

Beware it's a code made over a weekend and the goal was to have a finished game not to have a beautiful and performant code base ;)
But I would be happy if it helps you with your projects!

<h2>To test it: </h2>
It's over there: https://malya.itch.io/oh-no-my-coins
